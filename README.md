In this project, I will be utilising all of the knowledge gained within the course so far to create a basic recipe website page. Firstly, I will demonstrate my skills using the terminal to copy my repo from GitHub into my repos folder. From there, I will create a HTML file to include a boiler plate, headers, parapgraphs, links and images. I will have different recipes on the page.
